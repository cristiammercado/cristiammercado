### Hi, I'm Cristiam ðŸ‘‹


I'm a software developer from [Cartagena de Indias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartagena,_Colombia) but currently located in [BogotÃ¡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1).

I have about 7 years of experience in the field of analysis, design, development and implementation of software in companies from different business sectors. Currently I work at [MercadoLibre](https://www.mercadolibre.com/).

I have worked mainly with technologies on the JVM, specially with Java 8+, but I have also had the opportunity to develop in other languages and frameworks like NodeJS. 

In backend I've worked with frameworks like Spring Boot, Play Framework, Vert.x, Vavr, RxJava and techniques and concepts like microservices, CQRS and DDD.

I have also had the experience of creating applications that connect to relational and non-relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, MongoDB and redis.

In frontend I've had the opportunity to work on some projects with tools lik with Angular 6+ with Material, ReactJS, Typescript, Bootstrap 3+, jQuery, DataTables, etc.

If you want to contact me, here below I leave all the channels and social networks, do not hesitate to do so!
