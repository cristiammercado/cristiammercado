### Hi, I'm Cristiam ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer located in BogotÃ¡ (Colombia), with several years of experience in the field of analysis, design, development and implementation of software for almost all kinds of companies. Currently I work at [S4N](https://s4n.co), I think it is a great company.

I work mainly with Java 8+, but I've developed in other languages and frameworks. In backend I've worked with [Play](https://github.com/playframework/playframework), [Vertx](https://github.com/vert-x3), [Vavr](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr), [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), [microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html), [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) and [DDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html). In frontend I've had the opportunity to work on various projects, especially with [Angular 6+](https://github.com/angular) and [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react).

If you want to contact me, here below I leave all the channels and virtual networks, do not hesitate to do so!
